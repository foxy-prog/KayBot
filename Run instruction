How to run Kaybot locally (development):
1. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtualenv:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows PowerShell

2. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set your OpenRouter API key (optional for online mode):
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your_key_here'   # Linux/Mac
   setx OPENROUTER_API_KEY "your_key_here"   # Windows (restart needed)

4. Launch the app:
   python app.py

5. Open http://localhost:7860 in your browser. For Hugging Face Spaces, push the repo to your Space and ensure the dependencies are in requirements.txt
Calculate mass of NaCl needed to prepare 250 mL of 0.5 M NaCl.
If 2.5 g of Mg reacts with excess HCl, what volume of H2 at STP is produced?
Provide the pKa trend for carboxylic acids vs phenols with references.

  "Provide the pKa trend for carboxylic acids vs phenols with references.": "Summary:\nCarboxylic acids are generally stronger acids (pKa ~ 4-5) compared to phenols (pKa ~ 9-10) due to resonance stabilization of the carboxylate anion and better delocalization. Phenoxide ion is less stabilized. For authoritative references consult standard organic chemistry textbooks (e.g., March's Advanced Organic Chemistry) or NIST data.\n\nLaTeX/short: $pK_a(\\text{carboxylic acid})\\approx4-5;\\ pK_a(\\text{phenol})\\approx9-10$"
